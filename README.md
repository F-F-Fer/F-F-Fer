## Hi there! 👋 I'm Fernando.

🚀 With over a decade of experience, I've honed my skills in crafting top-notch proprietary enterprise software products. My journey is all about utilizing diverse technologies to design, develop, and deploy enterprise-class solutions while gaining deep insights into customers' needs and product usage.

👨‍🏭 Leading and mentoring teams, I establish coding standards and UI best practices. My extensive app development background ensures I'm always at the forefront of innovative UI engineering.

🛠️ Experience in creating and distributing Lua extensions for players around the world, adapting the solutions according to what they needed.

🔐 Industry Authentication standards like oAuth2? Yep, I've got you covered. Incorporating Authorization aspects into the UI framework is just another day at the office for me.
